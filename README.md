# chessProgram

Disclaimer: 

I'm mediocore at chess at best, and this program is even worse. I made this as a proof of concept, and as it shows, it's a good thing, I didn't spend more time on it. 
As it turns out, you need a better understanding of chess, if you want to code a chess program. Also minimax and chess doesn't go well together, so it's also slow as hell.
Sometimes it makes hillariously bad moves. Enjoy!
